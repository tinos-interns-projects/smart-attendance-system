## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Face Recognition**: Automatically detects and recognizes faces to log attendance seamlessly.
- **Event Tracking**: Captures **IN**, **BREAK START**, **BREAK END**, and **OUT** events for comprehensive attendance monitoring.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Implements a 5-minute cooldown to avoid duplicate entries.
- **Auto-Logout**: Automatically logs an **OUT** event if a break exceeds 2.5 hours.
- **Admin Panel**: Intuitive interface for managing employees and attendance logs.
- **Report Generation**: Export attendance data as **CSV** for easy reporting.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: View attendance trends through dynamic timelines and charts.

## 🧠 Face Recognition Workflow

1. **Face Detection**: Utilizes the HaarCascade Classifier for accurate face detection.
2. **Face Recognition**: Employs OpenCV's LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm for reliable identification.
3. **Attendance Logging**: Records events in a MySQL database with timestamps.
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Enforces a 5-minute cooldown to prevent redundant logs.
5. **Break Monitoring**: Automatically triggers an **OUT** event if a break exceeds 2.5 hours.

## 📊 Attendance Flow

1. **Initial Log**: Registers an **IN** event for the first scan of the day.
2. **Break Management**: Logs **BREAK START** and **BREAK END** for subsequent scans.
3. **Final Log**: Records an **OUT** event to close the attendance cycle.
4. **Auto-Logout**: Automatically logs **OUT** if a break exceeds 2.5 hours.
